Overview

This project performs sentiment analysis on movie reviews. It uses the Naive Bayes algorithm to predict whether a given sentence or movie review is positive or negative.
What does it do?

    Preprocesses movie reviews (removes stopwords, punctuation, and makes everything lowercase).
    Trains a machine learning model using a dataset of movie reviews.
    Predicts whether a given text has a positive or negative sentiment.
